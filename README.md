# A_Reinforcement_Learning_Approach_for_Train_Rescheduling

This project applies reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, specifically Q-learning and Îµ-greedy algorithms, to solve real-time train rescheduling challenges. The objective is to minimize delays and optimize the overall punctuality of trains. A custom environment was built using OpenAI's Gym framework to simulate train schedules, including variables like station distances, train speeds, and real-world delays. The RL agent is trained over thousands of episodes, learning to make decisions that reduce delays, avoid collisions, and improve scheduling efficiency.

The project tackles both simple and complex train scheduling problems, including scenarios involving multiple train types and real-world schedules. The model demonstrates effective learning, achieving better coordination of train movements and improving the reliability of train operations. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement learning to optimize dynamic systems in complex environments, offering a scalable solution for real-world railway networks.
